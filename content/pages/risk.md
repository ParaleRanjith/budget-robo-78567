      - question: RISKS
        answer: >+
          The chances of possibilities of loss in a business is an important
          factor to be taken care of. There can be several uncertainties
          regarding the outcomes and maintenance of a new venture in the
          market. 



      - question: MAJOR RISK
        answer: >+
          Technology risk which I can also relate to team risk. Since the
          service that we provide to the customers is new in the market, there
          is a high chance that the customers may face difficulties to find the
          appropriate service they need. 



      - question: CUSTOMER & TARGET SEGMENT
        answer: >+
          The segment which my venture will be providing service are those oneâ€™s
          who live in the same city where I set up my venture building. As a
          start-up company, it will be difficult for us to reach to customers
          who are far from us. Even though this is an AP based venture we would
          need to provide some services physically to the clients.
